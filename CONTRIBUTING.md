# Contributing to Blueprint

:tada: Thanks for doing so!

### Performing a release

1. `git checkout release` to make sure all commits are in place
1. `docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d` to make sure you are ready to run integration tests by spinning up a bunch of Docker containers.
1. `mvn release:prepare -DautoVersionSubmodules=true` to perform the release. Make sure you fill in appropriate versions.
1. `mvn release:clean` to get rid of a bunch of files generated by the Maven release plugin.
1. `docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down` to stop all Docker containers again.

This should trigger a (valid) release in Travis. Once the build is complete you can go ahead and edit the release so provide some additional descriptions.
